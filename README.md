### GhostScript

AutoPressPDF uses GhostScript for PDF optimization. It assumes that GhostScript is installed on your local machine and can be invoked using the gs command.

To install GhostScript, please follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system:

    * macOS: `brew install ghostscript`
    * Linux: Use your distribution's package manager, for example `sudo apt-get install ghostscript`
    * Windows: Download and install from GhostScript Official Website

Once installed, you can test if GhostScript is available by running:

```bash

gs --version

```

This should return the installed version of GhostScript, confirming it's correctly installed and accessible.
